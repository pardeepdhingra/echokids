# Audio System Fixes

## Problem

The app was experiencing audio session failures on iOS, with errors like "alternative audio session also failed" when trying to play TTS or preview voice sounds.

## Root Cause

The audio session configuration was too restrictive and didn't handle iOS audio session conflicts properly. The app was trying to use complex audio modes that aren't always supported on all devices.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Robust Audio Session Initialization

- **Multiple fallback modes**: The app now tries 3 different audio session configurations
- **Progressive degradation**: Starts with full features, falls back to simplified modes
- **Error handling**: Continues operation even if audio session fails
- **App-level initialization**: Audio session is set up when the app starts

### 2. Enhanced TTS Functionality

- **Better voice handling**: Uses language codes instead of specific voice IDs
- **Multiple fallback mechanisms**: TTS â†’ Beep â†’ Vibration
- **Improved error handling**: Graceful degradation when audio fails
- **Voice validation**: Checks if selected voice exists before using it

### 3. Testing and Debugging Tools

- **Audio System Test**: Comprehensive test button in Settings
- **Individual component tests**: Test TTS, Test Audio, Test Vibration
- **Console logging**: Detailed logs for debugging audio issues
- **Audio test script**: `npm run test:audio` for system verification

## Key Changes

### `src/utils/tts.ts`

- Complete rewrite of audio initialization
- Multiple fallback audio session modes
- Better error handling and logging
- Progressive fallback: TTS â†’ Beep â†’ Vibration

### `App.tsx`

- Added app-level audio session initialization
- Ensures audio is set up when app starts

### `src/screens/SettingsScreen.tsx`

- Added "Test Audio System" button
- Comprehensive audio testing capabilities
- Better error reporting

### `src/components/VocabularyGrid.tsx`

- Enhanced error handling for button presses
- Multiple fallback mechanisms
- Better logging for debugging

### `src/constants/index.ts`

- Changed default voice to use language code instead of specific voice ID
- More compatible with different devices

## Testing the Fixes

### 1. Run Audio System Test

```bash
npm run test:audio
```

### 2. In-App Testing

1. Open the app
2. Go to Settings
3. Try "Test TTS" button
4. Try "Test Audio System" button
5. Test vocabulary button presses

### 3. Console Logs

Check the console for detailed audio logs:

- `ðŸ”Š` Audio session initialization
- `ðŸŽ¤` TTS operations
- `ðŸ”‡` Fallback mechanisms
- `ðŸ“³` Vibration feedback

## Troubleshooting

### If Audio Still Doesn't Work

1. **Check Device Settings**
   - Ensure device is not on silent mode
   - Turn up device volume
   - Check if other apps can play audio

2. **Restart the App**
   - Close the app completely
   - Restart the device if needed
   - Try again

3. **Check Console Logs**
   - Look for audio session errors
   - Check which fallback mechanisms are being used
   - Verify TTS is being called

4. **Test Individual Components**
   - Try "Test TTS" first
   - Then try "Test Audio System"
   - Check if vibration works

### Common iOS Issues

- **Silent Mode**: Make sure the silent mode switch is off
- **Volume**: Ensure device volume is turned up
- **Audio Conflicts**: Close other audio apps
- **iOS Version**: Some older iOS versions may have compatibility issues
- **Device Restart**: Sometimes a device restart is needed

## Fallback Hierarchy

1. **Primary**: Text-to-Speech with selected voice
2. **Secondary**: Text-to-Speech with default voice
3. **Tertiary**: Beep sound
4. **Quaternary**: Vibration feedback
5. **Final**: Silent (with console logging)

## Technical Details

### Audio Session Modes

1. **Full Mode** (Primary)

   ```typescript
   {
     allowsRecordingIOS: false,
     staysActiveInBackground: false,
     playsInSilentModeIOS: true,
     shouldDuckAndroid: true,
     playThroughEarpieceAndroid: false,
     interruptionModeIOS: Audio.INTERRUPTION_MODE_IOS_DO_NOT_MIX,
     interruptionModeAndroid: Audio.INTERRUPTION_MODE_ANDROID_DO_NOT_MIX,
   }
   ```

2. **Simplified Mode** (Secondary)

   ```typescript
   {
     allowsRecordingIOS: false,
     staysActiveInBackground: false,
     playsInSilentModeIOS: true,
     shouldDuckAndroid: false,
     playThroughEarpieceAndroid: false,
   }
   ```

3. **Minimal Mode** (Tertiary)
   ```typescript
   {
     allowsRecordingIOS: false,
     playsInSilentModeIOS: true,
   }
   ```

### Voice Handling

- Uses language codes (`en-US`) instead of specific voice IDs
- Validates voice existence before use
- Falls back to default voice if selected voice fails
- Supports both iOS system voices and generic language codes

## Success Metrics

- âœ… Audio session initialization no longer fails
- âœ… TTS works on button press
- âœ… Voice preview works in settings
- âœ… Multiple fallback mechanisms ensure feedback
- âœ… Comprehensive testing tools available
- âœ… Better error handling and logging

## Future Improvements

- Add audio session recovery mechanisms
- Implement audio quality settings
- Add support for custom audio files
- Create audio diagnostics dashboard
- Add audio performance monitoring
